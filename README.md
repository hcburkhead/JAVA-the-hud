# JAVA-the-hud
Just. Another. Voice. Assistant. 
a personal AI to help you automate tasks by speaking to it with a GUI with waveforms to see responses. This acts as a wrapper for whatever LLM you want just needs an API Key

Use: 

command line: Download the repo and run it in Python in it's own virtual environment (python venv -name-). It should detect your microphone after initializing run [java-activate] 

The GUI is a plasmoid accessed in KDE (This project requires Linux -I use Arch btw...) which will run after you have started the backend ^SEE ABOVE^
